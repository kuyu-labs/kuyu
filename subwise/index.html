    <h1>Privacy Policy for Subwise: Subscription Tracker</h1>
    <span class="date">Effective Date: December 4, 2025</span>

    <p>This page informs users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decides to use our Service, the <strong>Subwise: Subscription Tracker</strong> application.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection Policy: We Collect NO Data</h2>

    <p>We believe in keeping your privacy simple and secure. The <strong>Subwise: Subscription Tracker</strong> application is designed to be a completely self-contained experience. While an internet connection may be required for downloading the app, receiving updates, or accessing external links (such as this Privacy Policy or developer contact information), the core gameplay and functionality do not require network access.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from users.</li>
        <li><strong>No Device Information:</strong> We do not collect any device identifiers, IP addresses, location data, or usage statistics.</li>
        <li><strong>No Third-Party Analytics or Advertising:</strong> The application does not use any third-party analytics services (like Google Analytics, Flurry, etc.) or advertising services that collect data about your activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your game progress (like high scores or current game state) may be stored locally on your device, but this information is never transmitted to us or any third party.</p>

    <h2>2. Service Providers</h2>

    <p>We do not employ third-party companies or individuals for the purpose of facilitating our Service, providing the Service on our behalf, performing Service-related services, or assisting us in analyzing how our Service is used, as we do not collect or analyze any user data.</p>

    <h2>3. Security</h2>

    <p>Since we do not collect any Personal Information from you, there is no data to be secured or protected by us. We strive to maintain a secure application experience, but please be aware that the security of your device itself is your responsibility.</p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>

    <p>Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. Given that we do not collect any personal data, we cannot knowingly collect information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information (which is impossible under current app functionality), we would immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to take necessary actions.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
